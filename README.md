'Rocket Optimisation Control and Kinematics Evaluation Tool'  
A sophisticated Rocket Simulation software, capable of computing the most fuel-efficient trajectory for Solar System interplanetary travel, with the "Hohmann Transfer Orbit".  By considering various factors such as the gravitational pull of the planets and their orbits, this software will enable users to identify the optimal flight path between two planets while minimising fuel consumption and travel time.
